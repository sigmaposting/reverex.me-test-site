    <p>I have a website now!</p>
    <p>Ok, making the site and domain with its dns config and stuff was INSANELY PAINFUL, so i included this
    vibecoded calculator, let this serve as a placeholder "thing" in the website so it won't be plain text.</p>
    <p>I may use this site for other projects, links and stuff. I'd have to learn more about web design tho.</p>
