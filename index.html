  <h1>Placeholder index.html file</h1>
  <p>I have a website now!</p>
  <p>Ok, making the site and domain with its dns config and stuff was INSANELY PAINFUL, so i included this
  vibecoded calculator, let this serve as a placeholder "thing" in the website so it won't be plain text.</p>
  <p>I may use this site for other projects, links and stuff. I'd have to learn more about web design tho.</p>
      <hr> <h2>Calculator thingy!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./vibecoded_calculator.html">Open the calculator!</a></li>
        </ul>
      <hr> <h2>css test</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./csstest/">css test site</a></li>
