            Div content, text and stuff, mainly text
            and more stuff, but mostly text, not so much stuff,
            , but still some stuff. Text is the main thing here.
            Brah I can't come up with more filler text.
            I fear I'll have to use Lorem Ipsum.
            Side note: How THE FUCK does copilot read my mind????

            This uses Gilroy™!
            </h1>
            <div class="textcontainer">
            it would be a fucking shame if that doesn't load and shows arial or 
            something else i fear. <br/>
            i'm afraid i must buy the stupid 100k yearly Gilroy™ license
            if i want to use a proper font without getting my ass sued
